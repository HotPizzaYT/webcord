This will only work if Discord is blocked with an extension and not through the internet network itself. If Discord is blocked through the internet, this will NOT work!

If you are blocked through a router firewall, use a VPN.

First, to begin using this, I'd advise you to begin creating your own "Contacts Spreadsheet", containing your token and people to contact. First you need your token. I will not be explaining how to do this. There are many ways to find your token. For the contacts you just click on your DM history with them and copy the numbers at the end of the url (eg. 454092365167198229).
